      Started work on a few projects. And as for "Ink Land" it is currently on hold, will see if me and the team continues on it. No promises<br>
      So one of the projects is a more versitile learning app. It should include a more robust editor along side a brand new studying interface.
      Sadly it won't be having the same focus as the other learning app (TULA). So soon welcome TUEA, the Technically Unnamed Education App.<br>
      Where will it be available? On the web! No need for download! Though there will be Linux, Windows and Mac builds for those who want.<br>
      Alongside that project I am also making Geometry Dash and Celeste levels/maps.
      To add onto the list I am also making a programming language. Got a dumb idea, so I decided to start work on it. More to say another time.<br><br>
      That's all folks! Now go do what you were doing before.

      So, I'm currently working on a little thing called "Learning App".<br>
      If it wasn't obvious from what type of app it is, it's an app made for studying.<br>
      It uses a learning method known as "Spaced Repetition", which o'boy is that fun implementing.<br>
      Expect it to be released sometime during October. (I hope)<br>
