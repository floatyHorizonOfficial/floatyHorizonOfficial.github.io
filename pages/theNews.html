      So, I'm currently working on a little thing called "Learning App".<br>
      If it wasn't obvious from what type of app it is, it's an app made for studying.<br>
      It uses a learning method known as "Spaced Repetition", which o'boy is that fun implementing.<br>
      Expect it to be released sometime during October. (I hope)<br>
